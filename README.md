## 🧐 About The Project

Today's digital world is fragmented. Financial tools are isolated from social context, and social platforms are centralized data silos. ChatWallet solves this by creating a single, unified platform where communication and value exchange are seamless and secure.

We believe that if you can chat with someone, you should be able to transact with them instantly, privately, and without intermediaries. By building on a foundation of decentralized identity, encrypted communication, and verifiable attestations, we aim to build a healthier and more trustworthy social fabric for the internet of value.

## ✨ Core Features

  * 👤 **Sovereign Identity (DIDs):** Full control over your digital self using Ceramic Network and OrbisDB. You are not the product.
  * 🔐 **Self-Custodial Wallet (BIP39):** Your keys, your crypto. EVM-compatible at launch, with a multichain future (Solana and more).
  * 💬 **Encrypted E2E Chat (XMTP):** Truly private, wallet-to-wallet communication. No one, not even us, can read your messages.
  * 👻 **Financial Privacy (Stealth Addresses):** Protect your on-chain history with untraceable, single-use addresses for receiving assets.
  * 🤝 **Verifiable Reputation (Attestations):** Build a web of trust through verifiable claims made by peers, compatible with open standards like EAS.
  * 🤖 **Account Abstraction Ready (SCAs):** Paving the way for next-gen UX with social recovery, gasless transactions, and more.
  * 🔗 **Multichain by Design:** Built from the ground up to support multiple blockchain ecosystems.
  * 📦 **Decentralized Storage (IPFS):** Your profile data and attestations are stored resiliently and without central points of failure.
